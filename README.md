So this will eventually become a full blown function testing suite. As of right now it's just capable of using basic comparisons based on function results and assertions given an input, but it'll be able to do more in the future.

## Planned Features
- Runtimes for each test
- Being able to nest tests
- Being able to test something's 'randomness'.

Will continue updating this as I work on it.
